# To-Do-web

Task Input: It allows users to input tasks through a text input field.

Add Task: It provides an 'add' button to add the input task to the to-do list. When the 'add' button is clicked, the input task is added to the list.

Empty Input Handling: It checks if the input field is empty. If it is, it doesn't add a new task to the list.

Task Display: It displays the tasks in an ordered list. Each task is displayed as a list item (li element) in the ordered list.
